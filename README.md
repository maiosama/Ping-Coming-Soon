## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned

I have used javascript to create the error message and style it to be able to reserve the CSS format for the form feild untouched untill the error message shows.<br>



### Continued development

this was my first project in Frontendmentor.com, but it won't be the last, I need to improve my CSS & javascript knowledge.

### Useful resources

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28353939/javascript-form-validation-multiple-conditions - This helped me for validiation for the email input field. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
